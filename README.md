Below, you can find the description of your third assignment, which also
includes the expected output of this assignment in the Application Walkthrough
section.
This week, you are expected to improve your existing Hotel Reservation System
by introducing six new room types. You should create a Room class and its
objects where it will hold roomâ€™s type (in a String), dailyCost (in an int),
roomSize (in an int) and hasBath (in Boolean). Furthermore, the dailyCost data
should be hidden and it should be only accessible via two public setter
(setCost()) and getter (getCost()) methods. You should initialize each Room
instance with the following type and specifications.
Room Type dailyCost roomSize hasBath
Single $100 15 False
Double $180 30 False
Club $250 45 True
Family $400 50 False
Family with View $450 50 True
Suite $650 80 True
Additionally, you are required to modify the variables of your Reservation class
to store the following information in a structure as shown below.
Variable Name Type
room Room
reservationMonth String
reservationStart int
reservationEnd int
dailyCost int
The hotel owners highlighted that June, July and August are their peak times
and stated that they would like to charge double for these months. Accordingly,
you are required to check the reservation month before calculating total price
and pass three variables to an overloaded calculateTotalPrice(), which includes
an integer multiplier variable.
All the reservations should be stored in a Reservation array and parsed as it
was implemented in the second assignment. Furthermore, all access to
instance variables of Reservation class should be made through getter and
setter methods.
